# Kotlin

A retail store chain wants to expand into a new neighbourhood. To make the number of clients as large as possible, the new branch should be at a distance of no more than K from all the houses in the neighbourhood. A is a matrix of size N x M. It represents the neighbourhood as a rectangular grid, in which each cell is an integer 0 (an empty plot) or a 1 (a house). The distance between two cells is calculated as the minimum number of cell borders that one has to cross to move from the source cell to the target cell. It does not matter whether the cells on the way are empty or occupied but it does not allow for moving through corners. A store can be only built on an empty plot. How many suitable locations are there?

For example, given K = 2 and matrix A = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]], houses are located in cells with coordinates (2, 3), (3, 1) and (3, 4). We can build a new store on two empty plots that are close enough to all the houses. The first possible empty plot is locvated at (3, 2). The distance to the first house at (2, 3) is 2. The distance to the second house at (3, 1) is 1. The third house at (3, 4) is at a distance of 2. The second possible empty plot is located at (3, 3). The distance to the first, second and third houses are 1, 2 and 1, respectively.

Write a function:

```
fun solution(K: Int, A: Array<IntArray>): Int
```

that, given a positive integer K and matrix A of size N x M, returns the number of empty plots close enough to all the houses.

Examples:
1. Given K = 2 and A = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]], the function should return 2, as explained above.
2. Given K = 1 and A = [[0, 1], [0, 0]], the function should return 2. We can build a store on empty plots at (1, 1) and (2, 2).
3. Given K = 4 and A = [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]], the function should return 8. Stores can be built on the following plots: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3) and (4, 4).

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
- K is an integer within the range [1..800];
- N and M are integers within the range [2..400];
- each element of matrix A is an integer within the range [0..1];
- there is at least one house.
