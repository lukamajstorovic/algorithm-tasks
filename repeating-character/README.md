# Kotlin

You are given a string S, in which one letter occurs twice. Every other letter occurs at most once.

Write a function:

```
fun solution(S: String): String
```

which, given a string S, returns a single-character string: the letter that occurs twice.

Examples:
1. Given S = "aba", the function should return "a".
2. Given S = "zz", the function should return "z".
3. Given S = "codility", the function should return "i".

Assume that:
- the length of string S is within the range [2..27];
- string S is made only of lowercase letters (a-z);
- all letters in S are distinct except one, which occurs twice.

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
